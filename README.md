# EmployeeTracker
Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. In this homework assignment, we were challenged to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

### Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:

• Add departments, roles, employees

• View departments, roles, employees

• Update employee roles
